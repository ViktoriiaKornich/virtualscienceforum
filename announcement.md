# Call for organizers

After a successful [inaugural session](inauguralsession.md) we aim to bring VVirtual Science Forum closer to its conceived goal: aid research to organize virtual events.

In order to get a step closer to it we are seeking for potential session organizers.
The necessary information to organize a session can be found [here](organizierguide.md).

We will be grateful if you could circulate this announcement among colleagues that could be interested in organizing a virtual session.
