# Call For Organizers

After a successful [inaugural session](inauguralsession.md), we aim to bring the Virtual Science Forum closer to its goal: aiding researchers to organize virtual events.

In order to get a step closer, we are now seeking organizers for our next sessions.
The information on how to organize a session can be found [here](organizerguide.md).

We will be grateful if you could circulate this announcement among colleagues that could be interested in organizing a virtual session.
