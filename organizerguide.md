# Organizer Guide

So, you are thinking of organizing a short virtual conference session. This is easy, rewarding, and takes little work. This manual will guide you through the process.

#### Bird’s eye view of what it takes
Here is a short summary of all the steps you will need to take

- Make a team of organizers
- Decide on a recent and exciting topic
- Write a brief description of the session
- Decide on the scale/format of the session: number of speakers and length of talks
- Make a list of possible author groups to approach
- Decide on a date that suits your timeline (should be at least 2 months in the future, so that you can find the speakers and announce the session properly)
- Submit an application to us
- After the time slot is reserved, approach the speakers, make a program
- Find the moderators for the talks, ensure that the moderators and the speakers try the software in advance
- Advertise the event
- Approve participant applications for registration.
- Run the session
- Summarize your experience

#### Basic facts

- We support sessions of up to 3 hours in a single day (longer sessions have problems with retention).
- There is essentially one time slot that suits America and Europe: 12:00–15:00 EST.
- Both conventional conference talks of up to one hour (including questions), and 10-15 minute talks work well.
- We require that all the videos are recorded and published on the website after the session.

#### Application form

Apply via a github issue [here](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?assignees=&labels=application&template=application.md&title=Please+specify+the+session+title) (requires a github.com account).

## Detailed instructions

### Planning and application: two months before the session

Choose the organizer team of 2-4 people. Since you will be inviting the speakers and the audience, your team should have good connections in the community. It is also a good idea to find organizers from more than one research group/university.

Decide on the topic of the session. We strongly recommend to focus on recent developments: these make it easier to attract an audience, and you benefit from a shorter waiting period until the conference.

Choose a session name. Write a brief explanation of what the topic is, and why it is important. These will eventually go on the session webpage, so try and make them clean and attractive. If possible, prepare a poster-like image to go along with the description.

Make a list of prospective speakers that you plan to approach. Since the virtual conferences are experimental in nature, we recommend approaching groups of authors instead of single researchers. This also gives an extra opportunity for less senior researchers to present exciting work.

Choose a date and time slot that suits your session. Try to avoid conflicts with conferences on related topics, major holidays, etc.

Finally, submit the materials that you collected to the VSF. At this stage we aim to accept all applications after basic review (unless the demand is overwhelming).

### Reaching out to speakers: at least 6 weeks before the session

Once we approved your application and reserved your time slot, you and your co-organizers can start contacting the speakers. The length of your seminar shouldn't exceed 3 hours, so once you decide the length and format of the talks, adjust the number of speakers accordingly.

You should aim to secure your speakers at least one month prior to your event.

### Finalizing and announcing: at least 4 weeks before the session

Once your program is complete, we will prepare a page for your session on the VSF website and a registration form for the participants. Now you can start advertising your session.

We will announce the session to anyone signed up to our mailing list and publically through our Twitter account, but since you have connections in your specific community, the most effective advertising will come from you. Use your resources. For example you can consider:

- Announcing the session to your colleagues via email
- Posting about it on social media

We of course ask you to be considerate and avoid spamming your colleagues.

### Final preparation: 1 week before the session

In the virtual conference setting, moderators play a vital role. Find moderators for your event. The moderator's role is demanding, and we recommend finding more than one person to fill it. For example, you might want to have one person in charge of introducing the speakers and moderate the question, and a second one checking who want to asks questions and making sure everything is running smoothly. 

Set up an appointment with the speakers and the moderators to introduce them to the platform. 

### During the session

Make final technical checks shortly before the session starts. By this time you, the moderators, and the speakers should know how the platform works (it’s easy, but requires some preparation).

Give a brief opening and closing speech. In the opening speech, introduce the session, and remind participants of the code of conduct.

### After the session

Review the event page adding the recordings of the talks. If you like, add any concluding remarks to the page content.

VSF is a newly developed platform, and we welcome your feedback and overall evaluation of your experience. Please write a short summary with your thoughts and suggestions: what worked well, what didn’t, and what would you like to improve.

## Conclusion

That’s all it takes. Let us know if you have any questions, and we’re looking forward to hosting your session!
