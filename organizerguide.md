# Organizer Guide

So, you are thinking of organizing a short virtual event. This is easy, rewarding, and takes little work. This manual will guide you through the process.

#### Bird’s eye view of what it takes
Here is a short summary of all the steps you will need to take

- Build a team of organizers
- Decide on a recent and exciting topic
- Write a brief description of the event
- Decide on the scale/format of the event: length; number of talks; whether to have only invited talks or also contributed talks; whether to have a poster session...
- Make a list of possible speakers to approach
- Decide on a date (should be at least 2 months in the future, so that you can find the speakers and announce the event properly)
- Submit an application to us
- Approach the speakers, invite submissions for the contributed talks (if you have them) and start making a program
- Find the moderators for the talks
- Advertise the event
- Build a webpage / create a registration and if applicable abstract submission form.
- Email the Zoom link to the registered participants one or two days before the event
- Test the software with the moderators and speakers the day before the event
- Run the event and have fun!

#### Basic facts

- We support sessions of up to 3 hours in a single day (longer sessions have problems with retention).
- One timeslot can suit only two timezones: America/Europe, Europe/Asia or Asia/America. You can use [this website](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) to find the timeslot that best suits your needs. 
- Both conventional conference talks of up to one hour (including questions), and 10-15 minute talks work well.
- We require that all the videos are recorded and published on the website after the session.

#### Application form

Apply via a github issue [here](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?assignees=&labels=application&template=application.md&title=Please+specify+the+session+title) (requires a github.com account).

## Detailed instructions

### Planning and application: two months before the event

Build an organizer team of 2--4 people. Since you will be inviting the speakers and the audience, your team should have good connections in the community. It is also a good idea to find organizers from more than one research group/university.

Decide on the topic of the session. We strongly recommend to focus on recent developments: these make it easier to attract an audience, and you benefit from a shorter waiting period until the conference.

Choose a name for your event. Write a brief explanation of what the topic is, and why it is important. This will eventually go on the event's webpage, so try and make it clean and attractive. If possible, prepare an image to go along with the description.

Make a list of prospective speakers that you plan to approach. 

Choose a date and time slot for your event. Try to avoid conflicts with conferences on related topics, major holidays, etc.

Finally, submit this information to the VSF. At this stage we aim to accept all applications after basic review (unless the demand is overwhelming).

### Reaching out to speakers: at least 6 weeks before the session

Once we approved your application and reserved your time slot, you and your co-organizers can start contacting the speakers. The length of your seminar shouldn't exceed 3 hours, so once you decide the length and format of the talks, adjust the number of speakers accordingly.

You should aim to secure your speakers at least one month prior to your event.

### Finalizing and announcing: 4 weeks before the session

Once your program is complete, we will prepare a page for your session on the VSF website and a registration form for the participants. Now you can start advertising your session.

We will announce the session to anyone signed up and publically through our twitter account, but since you have community connections, you hold the advertising job. Use your resources. For example you can consider:

- Announcing the session to your colleagues via email
- Mentioning it during your travel
- Posting about it on social media

This aspect is not different from the traditional conferences: mailing lists, professional contacts, flyers, social media etc. We of course ask you to be considerate and avoid spamming your colleagues.

### Final preparations: 1 week before the session

In the virtual conference setting moderators play a vital role. Find moderators for your event. The moderator's role is demanding, and we recommend finding more than one person to fill it. The moderators should also be familiar with the sesion topic.

Set up an appointment with the speakers and the moderators to introduce them to the platform. It is likely that a common slot for all might be hard to find and individual appointments might become necessary.
If your session is over-subscribed, we will ask you to filter the applicants list that you want to allow participating in the session.

### During the session

Make final technical checks shortly before the session starts. By this time you, the moderators, and the speakers should know how the platform works (it’s easy, but requires some preparation).

Give a brief opening and closing speech. In the opening speech, introduce the session, and remind participants of the code of conduct.

### After the session

Review the event page with the published recordings of the talks. If you like, add any concluding remarks to the page content.

VSF is a newly developed platform, and we welcome your feedback and overall evaluation of your experience. Please write a short summary with your thoughts and suggestions: what worked well, what didn’t, and what would you like to improve.

## Conclusion

That’s all it takes. It should all fit within about a working day if you have a good idea. Let us know if you have any questions, and we’re looking forward to hosting your session!
