# Speaker's Corner

Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speaker's Corner seminars are meant to provide a platform
for everyone who would like to share their research.

## Give a talk
The series is hence on a "self-invitation" basis, where you register for giving a talk through the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md) and
bring your own audience. Every week, an announcement email is sent to the Speaker's Corner mailing list (register [here](mailinglist.md)) 
containing all of the upcoming talks. That way, more potential participants will learn about your talk and may decide to join.
