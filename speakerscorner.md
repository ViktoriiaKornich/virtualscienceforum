# Speaker's Corner

Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speaker's Corner seminars are a platform
for everyone who would like to share their research. Do you have a new pre-print and want to create an accompanying video lecture or just a cool result you would like to share with the community? Speaker's corner allows you to create, advertise and share your talk via Virtual Science Forum platform.

## Give a talk
The series is hence on a "self-invitation" basis, where you register for giving a talk through the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md) and
bring your own audience. Every week, an announcement email is sent to the Speaker's Corner mailing list (register [here](mailinglist.md)) 
containing all of the upcoming talks. That way, more potential participants will learn about your talk and may decide to join.

## How it works

1. Pick the topic of your talk, date and time (must be at least two weeks in the future), and make sure all your co-authors know about your presentation.
2. Fill in the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md) (here you can add the arXiv number of your preprint!) 
3. VSF:

  - checks availability of your time slot and confirm the date\
  - creates the zoom meeting and shares the registration link and host key with you\
  - announces your talk in the VSF Speaker's Corner mailing list and on this website

4. Make sure to advertise your talk and invite participants to register on VSF website
5. You are welcome to moderate your talk yourself as well as invite a colleague to be your moderator
6. VSF recoords your talk, forwards it to you afterwards and then publishes it in the dedicated YouTube channel
