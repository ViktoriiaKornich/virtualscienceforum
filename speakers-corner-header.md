# Speakers' Corner

Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speakers' Corner seminars are a platform for everyone who would like to share their research.
Do you have a new preprint and want to create an accompanying video lecture or just a cool result you would like to share with the community? Speakers' corner allows you to create, advertise and share your talk via the Virtual Science Forum platform.

### Give a talk
The series is hence on a "self-invitation" basis, where you register for giving a talk through the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md&labels=application&title=Speakers%27%20corner%20talk%20application) and
bring your own audience. Every week, an announcement email is sent to the Speakers' Corner mailing list (register [here](mailinglist.md)) 
containing all of the upcoming talks. That way, more potential participants will learn about your talk and may decide to join.

### How it works

1. Pick the topic of your talk, date and time (must be at least two weeks in the future), and make sure all your co-authors know about your presentation and agree.
2. Fill in the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md&labels=application&title=Speakers%27%20corner%20talk%20application)
3. The VSF does:
  - check availability of your time slot and confirm the date
  - create the zoom meeting, open the registration, and give you the host key
  - announce your talk in the VSF Speakers' Corner mailing list and on this website
4. Make sure to advertise your talk and invite participants to register for the talk
5. You are welcome to moderate your talk yourself as well as invite a colleague to be your moderator
6. VSF records your talk, forwards it to you for approval, and publishes it in the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQEx4iW7u_x3jX742kUZLw)
