## Welcome

Virtual Science Forum is a [volunteer-run](whoweare.md) open platform aiming to accommodate organization of online conferences.
We organize, host, and support virtual academic events.
Additionally we develop best practices and provide recommendations for all community members.

## What we do

We are now hosting the [Long Range Colloquium](long_range_colloquium.md) and on October 5 we will host the [Observing Anyons 2020](Observing_Anyons_2020.md) mini-conference. We also hosted virtual sessions on [quantum information and machine learning](inauguralsession.md) and a workshop on [Scanning Probe Microscopy](SPM_workshop.md).

We offer beginning-to-end support for organizing an academic event of your own, check out the [organizer guide](organizerguide.md) to see what it takes. It could be a seminar series, a workshop or a tutorial. Now that summer has arrived, we particularly encourage applications for summer schools organized by graduate students, post docs or early-career researchers.
