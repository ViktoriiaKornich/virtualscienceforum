## Welcome

Virtual Science Forum is a [volunteer-run](whoweare.md) open platform aiming to accommodate organization of online conferences.
We organize, host, and support virtual academic events.
Additionally we develop best practices and provide recommendations for all community members.

## What we do

We offer beginning-to-end support for organizing an academic event of your own, check out the [organizer guide](organizerguide.md) to see what it takes. It could be a seminar series, a workshop or a tutorial. Now that winter has arrived, we particularly encourage applications for winter schools organized by graduate students, post docs or early-career researchers.
