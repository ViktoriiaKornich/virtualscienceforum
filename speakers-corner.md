# Speakers' Corner

Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speakers' Corner seminars are a platform for everyone who would like to share their research.
Do you have a new preprint and want to create an accompanying video lecture or just a cool result you would like to share with the community? Speakers' corner allows you to create, advertise and share your talk via Virtual Science Forum platform.

### Give a talk
The series is hence on a "self-invitation" basis, where you register for giving a talk through the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md&labels=application&title=Speakers%27%20corner%20talk%20application) and
bring your own audience. Every week, an announcement email is sent to the Speakers' Corner mailing list (register [here](mailinglist.md)) 
containing all of the upcoming talks. That way, more potential participants will learn about your talk and may decide to join.

### How it works

1. Pick the topic of your talk, date and time (must be at least two weeks in the future), and make sure all your co-authors know about your presentation and agree.
2. Fill in the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md&labels=application&title=Speakers%27%20corner%20talk%20application)
3. VSF:
  - checks availability of your time slot and confirm the date
  - creates the zoom meeting, opens the registration, and gives you the host key
  - announces your talk in the VSF Speakers' Corner mailing list and on this website
4. Make sure to advertise your talk and invite participants to register for the talk
5. You are welcome to moderate your talk yourself as well as invite a colleague to be your moderator
6. VSF records your talk, forwards it to you for approval, and publishes it in the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQEx4iW7u_x3jX742kUZLw)

## Upcoming talks


### Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
#### Antonio Manesco (University of São Paulo)

> Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover, we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

### Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
#### Hamed Vakili (Dept. of Physics University of Virginia)

> Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping. Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

### Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
#### Joshuah T. Heath (Boston College)

> The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

### Topological Band Structures in the Offset-Parameter-Dependence of Small Josephson Circuits
#### Valla Fatemi (Yale University)

> We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits that simulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to design circuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that produces a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which topological phase transitions can be triggered *in situ*. We argue that currently available superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that probe topological properties inaccessible in condensed matter systems.

### Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite bias
#### André Melo (Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology)

> Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work, we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries.
