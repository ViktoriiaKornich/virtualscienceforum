### Superconductivity mediated by a third-electron: Spin-triplet superconductivity from excitonic eﬀect in doped band insulators
#### Valentin Crépel (MIT)

> In this talk, I will comprehensively review the general electronic mechanism for superconductivity introduced in arXiv:2012.08528 and arXiv:2103.12060. There, it is shown that a non-retarded pairing interaction can be produced from the electron-electron repulsion itself through virtual inter-band transitions. The theory presented is analytically controlled by a strong-coupling expansion in the kinetic energy term and explicitly demonstrated in doped band insulators with the example of an extended Hubbard model. This work demonstrates a powerful method for studying strong coupling superconductivity. It also offers realistic new routes to realize unconventional superconducting state with, for instance, finite angular momentum or spin-triplet pairing.

### Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
#### Antonio Manesco, University of São Paulo

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover, we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

### Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
#### Hamed Vakili, Dept. of Physics University of Virginia

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping. Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

### Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
#### Joshuah T. Heath, Boston College

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

### Topological Band Structures in the Offset-Parameter-Dependence of Small Josephson Circuits
#### Valla Fatemi, Yale University

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits that simulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to design circuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that produces a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which topological phase transitions can be triggered *in situ*. We argue that currently available superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that probe topological properties inaccessible in condensed matter systems.

### Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite bias
#### André Melo, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work, we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries.

### Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices
#### Julien Barrier, The University of Manchester, U.K.

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands recurring at rational ($p/q$) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10$^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and the mean free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are $4q$ times degenerate and all the degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at $1/q$ fractions for electrical probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.

### Topological phonons in oxide perovskites controlled by light
#### Bo Peng, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications. We find that topological phonons – nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points – are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and external conditions (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase of these compounds all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states. In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation with light.

### Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard model
#### Dalla Torre Emanuele, Bar-Ilan University

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems.

### Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking
#### Vasilii Vadimov, QCD Labs, Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional topological superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting state. However, no interacting one-dimensional many-body system is known to spontaneously break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We introduce a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes may appear in a many-body systems without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs.

### Strain-engineering the topological type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2
#### Antonio Manesco, University of São Paulo

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

In this work, the electronic and elastic properties of the type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$, in equilibrium and under strain, were systematically studied within the scope of density functional theory (DFT) and effective models. We have demonstrated that strain-engineering is an effective route for manipulating its electronic and topological properties. We have shown that compressive and tensile deformations control the Dirac node momentum and their energy relative to the Fermi level. Moreover, it is possible to lower or increase the overlap between the low-energy wave functions and suppress trivial bands, opening the way for superconductivity, Liftshtz transitions, and a hybrid type-I and type-II Dirac semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we provided a minimal effective model for the Dirac cone and derive the mentioned strain effects using lattice regularization, providing an inexpensive way for further theoretical investigations and easy comparison with experiments. We also proposed statically controlling the electronic-structure with the intercalation of alkali-element species into the van der Waals gap, resulting in a similar physical response to the one obtained by strain-engineering.

### Electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowires
#### Chun-Xiao Liu, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

We study the electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al heterostructures as explored in a recent experiment [S. Vaitiekenas \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2020)], combining both spectroscopic results and microscopic device simulations. In particular, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band bending at the InAs/EuS interface. The resulting band offset value serves as an essential input to subsequent microscopic device simulations, allowing us to map the electronic wave function distribution. We conclude that the magnetic proximity effects at the Al/EuS as well as the InAs/EuS interfaces are both essential to achieve topological superconductivity at zero applied magnetic field. Mapping the topological phase diagram as a function of gate voltages and proximity-induced exchange couplings, we show that the ferromagnetic hybrid nanowire with overlapping Al and EuS layers can become a topological superconductor within realistic parameter regimes. Our work highlights the need for a combined experimental and theoretical effort for faithful device simulation.

### Floquet Gauge Pump
#### Abhishek Kumar, Indiana University Bloomington

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

We introduce the concept of a Floquet gauge pump whereby a dynamically engineered Floquet Hamiltonian is employed to reveal the inherent degeneracy of the ground state in interacting systems. We demonstrate this concept in a one-dimensional XY model with periodically driven couplings and transverse field. In the high frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static XY and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms, with the XY interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases are cycled, it reveals the ground state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered and disordered phases. We discuss experimental requirements needed to realize the Floquet gauge pump in a synthetic quantum spin system of interacting trapped ions.

### Bloch-Lorentz magnetoresistance oscillations in delafossites
#### Kostas Vilkelis, Qutech, Delft University of Technology

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Recent measurements of the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of delafossites (PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$) observed oscillations which closely resemble the Aharanov-Bohm effect. We develop a semiclassical theory of these oscillations and show that they are a consequence of the quasi-2D dispersion of delafossites. We observe that the Lorentz force created by an in-plane magnetic field makes the out-of-plane motion of electrons oscillatory, similarly to Bloch oscillations. Analysis of the visibility of these Bloch-Lorentz oscillations reveals the mean-free path to be $l \approx 4.4 \mu m$ in comparison to the literature in-plane mean free path of $20 \mu m$. The mean-free path is reduced as a consequence of the out-of-plane relaxation and sample wall scattering. Our theory offers a way to design an experimental geometry that is better suited for probing the phenomenon and to investigate the out-of-plane dynamics of ballistic quasi-two-dimensional materials.

### Amorphous topological phases protected by continuous rotation symmetry
#### Helene Spring, TU Delft

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

Protection of topological surface states by reflection symmetry breaks down when the boundary of the sample is misaligned with one of the high symmetry planes of the crystal. We demonstrate that this limitation is removed in amorphous topological materials, where the Hamiltonian is invariant on average under reflection over any axis due to continuous rotation symmetry. While the local disorder caused by the amorphous structure weakens the topological protection, we demonstrate that the edge remains protected from localization. In order to classify such phases we perform a systematic search over all the possible symmetry classes in two dimensions and construct the example models realizing each of the proposed topological phases. Finally, we compute the topological invariant of these phases as an integral along a meridian of the spherical Brillouin zone of an amorphous Hamiltonian.

### Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition
#### Elizabeth Dresselhaus, University of California, Berkeley

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling flow close to the critical fixed point in the parameter plane spanned by the longitudinal and Hall conductivities has been studied vigorously both by experiments and with numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer [Nucl. Phys. B 941, 458 (2019)] has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we confirm the marginal scaling of the longitudinal conductivity towards the conjectured fixed-point value $\sigma_{xx} = 2/\pi$. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents $\nu_{eff}$, which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We confirm this idea by exact numerical determination of $\nu_{eff}$ in suitably chosen models.

### Deconfinement of Majorana vortex modes produces a superconducting Landau level
#### Michał Pacholski, Instituut-Lorentz, Universiteit Leiden

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

A spatially oscillating pair potential $\Delta(r)=\Delta_0 e^{i K\cdot x}$ with momentum $K>\Delta_0/\hbar v$ drives a deconfinement transition of the Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of a Fu-Kane heterostructure (a 3D topological insulator with Fermi velocity $v$, on a superconducting substrate with gap $\Delta_0$, in a perpendicular magnetic field). In the deconfined phase at zero chemical potential the Majorana fermions form a dispersionless Landau level, protected by chiral symmetry against broadening due to vortex scattering. The coherent superposition of electrons and holes in the Majorana Landau level is detectable as a local density of states oscillation with wave vector $\sqrt{K^2-(\Delta_0/\hbar v)^2}$. The striped pattern also provides a means to measure the chirality of the Majorana fermions.

### Quantum tunneling dynamics in complex SYK model quenched-coupled to a cool-bath
#### Yevheniia Cheipesh, Leiden University

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes interacting fermionic zero modes in zero spatial dimensions, e.g. quantum dot, with interactions strong enough to completely washout quasiparticle excitations in the infrared. In this note, we consider the complex-valued SYK model at temperature $T$ coupled to a zero temperature reservoir by a quench. We find out that the tunneling current dynamics reveals a way to distinguish the SYK non-Fermi liquid (nFL) initial state of the subsystem from the disordered Fermi liquid. Temperature dependent contribution to the current's half-life scales linearly in $T$ at low temperatures for the SYK nFl state, while for the Fermi liquid it scales as $T^2$. This provides a characteristic signature of the SYK non-Fermi liquid in a non-equilibrium measurement.

### Flat band induced non-Fermi liquid behavior of multicomponent fermions
#### Pramod Kumar, Aalto University

<details><summary>abstract</summary>

We investigate multicomponent fermions in a flat band and predict experimental signatures of non-Fermi liquid behavior. We use dynamical mean-field theory to obtain the density, double occupancy and entropy in a Lieb lattice for $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ components. We derive a mean-field scaling relation between the results for different values of $\mathcal{N}$, and study its breakdown due to beyond-mean field effects. The predicted signatures occur at temperatures above the N\'eel temperature and persist in presence of a harmonic trapping potential, thus they are observable with current ultracold gas experiments.
