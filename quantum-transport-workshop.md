# Mini-workshop: Introduction to computational quantum transport with Kwant

![Kwant workflow](media/kwant-workflow.svg)

In this four-hour workshop we introduce the basics of quantum transport simulations of mesoscopic devices using the Kwant software package.
Our entry-level workshop is aimed at active condensed matter physicists who have a basic knowledge of Python.
We do not expect familiarity with Kwant or quantum transport simulations.

We thank https://mybinder.org, a public service and a volunteer-run open-source project with cloud resources sponsored by Google Cloud, OVH, GESIS Notebooks and the Turing Institute for providing a computational environment for the workshop.

You can run the course notebooks interactively [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.kwant-project.org%2Fkwant%2Fminicourse.git/master?filepath=index.md) or download a [zip archive](https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/minicourse/builds/artifacts/master/raw/qt_workshop_notebooks.zip?job=prepare%20archive) with notebooks (you'll need Kwant and Jupyter to run them).
