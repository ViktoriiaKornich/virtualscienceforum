# Mini-workshop: Introduction to computational quantum transport with Kwant

![Kwant workflow](media/kwant-workflow.svg)

In this four-hour workshop we will introduce the basics of quantum transport simulations of mesoscopic devices using the Kwant software package.
Our entry-level workshop is aimed at active condensed matter physicists who have a basic knowledge of Python.
We do not expect familiarity with Kwant or quantum transport simulations.

The workshop will begin with a brief introduction of the essential theoretical background, followed by hands-on examples of quantum transport simulations.
During the ensuing interactive sessions the participants will directly apply what they have learned and receive immediate feedback.
We will conclude with an overview of advanced topics which will be left for later self-study.

The participation is free, but the amount of places is limited, so please [register](#registration).

We thank https://mybinder.org, a public service and a volunteer-run open-source project with cloud resources sponsored by Google Cloud, OVH, GESIS Notebooks and the Turing Institute for providing a computational environment for the workshop.
