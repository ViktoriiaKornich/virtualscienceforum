# Privacy policy

Our goal at the Virtual Science Forum (VSF) is to handle your information transparently and in a maximally secure and private way.
That said, our resources are limited, and we might make mistakes that we will fix as soon as possible.
If you have any questions or concerns, contact us at privacy@virtualscienceforum.org.

1. All materials related to organizing VSF activities are publicly available in http://github.com/virtualscienceforum/
2. When you register for a meeting, the information you provide is stored on Zoom servers, subject to the Zoom [privacy policy](https://zoom.us/privacy). 
3. When you attend a meeting Zoom collects technical information about your connection and device. This information appears to be automatically deleted a short period of time after the meeting.
4. We record and publish all VSF meetings, and therefore if you ask a question it may be published in a video.
5. Finally, if you sign up for the mailing list announcements, we store your contact information at our email provider [mailgun](https://mailgun.com). We only use this information to announce Virtual Science Forum activities.

We do not share your information with any other parties and do not use it for any other purposes.
