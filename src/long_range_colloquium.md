# Long Range Colloquium

The Long Range Colloquium is a bi-weekly seminar series covering the latest developments in condensed matter physics and quantum information. We alternate experimental and theory talks to keep the schedule exciting for a varied audience: have a look at our 2021 schedule below!
You can also find all the information and recordings for our 2020 talks [here](/#/long_range_colloquium-2020).

The colloquium runs every other Wednesday at 1:30 PM ET / 19:30 CEST.
Attendance is open to everyone, but please register to attend! If you would like to hear about upcoming talks, you can subscribe to the colloquim mailing list [here](https://virtualscienceforum.org/#/mailinglist).
