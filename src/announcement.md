# Call For Organizers

The goal for the Virtual Science Forum is to aid researchers in organizing virtual conferences, and to facilitate dissemination of results through our Speakers' corner event.

If you would like to contribute to these goals directly or have suggestions, please consider [reaching out](contact.md) and joining our team!
Or if you know of someone whom you think might like to join our efforts, please let them now instead.

If instead you are looking for information on how to organize a virtual conference, take a look [here](organizerguide.md).
