## Welcome

Virtual Science Forum is a [volunteer-run](whoweare.md) open platform aiming to accommodate organization of online conferences.
We organize, host, and support virtual academic events.
Additionally we develop best practices and provide recommendations for all community members.

## What we do

We offer beginning-to-end support for organizing an academic event of your own, check out the [organizer guide](organizerguide.md) to see what it takes. It could be a seminar series, a workshop or a tutorial. We prioritize upholding a safe, accessible, inclusive and equitable online environment for all across the spectrum of identities and lived experiences. We encourage participation, either as speakers, organizers or audience, of all members of the scientific community.
