# Recent Developments in Exotic and Unconventional Superconductivity
**<time data-format="MMMM D YYYY H:mm" datetime="2022-03-30T12:00:00+00:00">March 30 2022 14:00</time>â€“<time data-format="H:mm" datetime="2022-03-31T17:00:00+00:00">17:00</time>** (all times are in <span id="timezone">CET</span> timezone)

Unconventional superconductivity is a rapidly developing field that is of high interest nowadays, because new materials can support new technologies. E.g., p-wave superconductor is a potential host for Majorana fermions. Our conference is about various types of unconventional superconductors and also about exotic superconductivity, namely non-equilibrium superconductivity, superconductivity in flat-band systems. This conference will be interesting for both experimentalists and theoreticians.
