# Andreev reflection in quantum Hall systems: 2021 state of the union 
**December 9 2021**

![Collage of Andreev quantum Hall systems](media/arqh_collage.svg){ width=80% }

A combination of superconductivity with quantum Hall effect allows perfectly nonlocal crossed Andreev reflection, which has made it a target of experimental search for more than a decade.

Due to progress in material physics and emergence of new hybrid platforms, this search has resulted in a series of
experiments observing a combined effect of chiral edge states and superconductivity.
At the same time, measurements of Andreev conductance in the quantum Hall regime demonstrate wildly different behaviors,
sometimes in disagreement with existing theoretical predictions.

In this workshop we aimed to bring together experts working in the field, review observations and their interpretation, and identify the possible ways forward.

## Workshop summary

Combining Andreev reflection with chiral movement of electrons is an open topic of experimental search and theoretical ideation for more than two decades. While the low magnetic field regime has been observed and offers a clear interpretation, the limit of full Landau quantization has only recently become available to experiments. There are two prominent predicted manifestations of Andreev reflection in the quantum Hall regime. 1) The supercurrent in the chiral regime acquires the Aharanov-Bohm periodicity for magnetic flux penetrating the normal region. 2) A single superconducting electrode enables injection of holes into the downstream current and, in lattice-matched graphene, generates a quantized negative nonlocal resistance. While the supercurrent signature remains unseen, nonlocal resistance measurements finding negative values (with mysteries) feature prominently in recent experimental works. For the overview see Carlo Beenakker's talk [below](#the-search-for-chiral-andreev-edge-states).

The three experiments of the workshop used different material platforms and geometries summarized in the table below. The experiment presented by Gleb Finkelstein observed chaotic conductance oscillations that rapidly decay with the loss of phase coherence. This result and the authors' interpretation agree with recent [numerical simulations](#mechanisms-of-andreev-reflection-in-quantum-hall-graphene) and the [analytical theory](#mesoscopic-conductance-along-the-proximitized-quantum-hall-edge) presented in the satellite talks. This data also exhibits jumps with magnetic field, consistent with the [analysis](#mesoscopic-conductance-along-the-proximitized-quantum-hall-edge) of the effect of vortex entrance. The other two experiments demonstrate a systematically negative downstream resistance with no apparent mesoscopic fluctuations. The results reported by Onder Gul extend to the fractional quantum Hall regime, that was analysed by the authors using the renormalization group approach as well as in one of the [satellite talks](#induced-superconductivity-in-fqh-edges-in-presence-of-dissipation). The reasons for the difference in the observations are as yet unknown. In addition to these works, the [experiment](#longitudinal-resistance-oscillations-in-insbas-2degs-in-a-quantum-hall-regime) reported by Ivan Kulesh, observed fluctuations in the downstream resitance interpreted as tunneling through the quantum Hall bulk—a phenomenon that may complicate the analysis of Andreev reflection in small samples (relevant to the experiments presented by Onder and Gleb).

Between the seminars and the discussion session, a number of open questions, needed experiments, and needed theory, were identified.

### Open questions

1. What is the nature of the persistent negative nonlocal resistances in the measurements presented by Onder and Javad?
2. Is it possible to experimentally observe the influence of valley physics in the graphene versions of these systems?
3. Are the differences in contact types (edge contact for graphene, planar proximitization for InAs) important? Relatedly, what about the difference between a soft and hard edge potential in the NS contact region?
4. Can the negative influence of the superconducting vortices be eliminated in the experiment?
5. Can the systematic difference between Andreev and normal reflections be explained by the breaking of particle-hole symmetry by the finite bias?

### Ideas for further experiments

1. Noise measurement to reveal the charge of the Andreev reflected holes.
2. Tunneling into the possible zero mode at the end of the finger in the geometry presented by Onder. 
3. Quantum point contact at QH-superconductor interface. 
4. Chicken-wire patterns for superconducting films to minimize the presence of vortex normal cores.
5. Chern insulator normal regions for low-external-field versions of these experiments. 
6. Type-II superconductors with high Hc1 so that QH develops before vortices.
