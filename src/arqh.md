# Superconductors + quantum Hall systems: state of the union 2021
**December 9 2021 <time data-format="H:mm" datetime="2021-12-09T14:30:00+00:00">14:30</time>–<time data-format="H:mm" datetime="2021-12-09T17:00:00+00:00">17:00</time>** (all times are in <span id="timezone">UTC</span> timezone).

A combination of superconductivity with quantum Hall effect allows to produce perfectly 
nonlocal crossed Andreev reflection, which made it a target of experimental search going on for more than a decade.

Due to the progress in material physics and emergence of new hybrid platforms, this search resulted in a series of
experiments observing a combined effect of chiral edge states and superconductivity.
At the same time, measurements of Andreev conductance in the quantum Hall regime demonstrate wildly different behaviors,
sometimes in disagreement with existing theoretical predictions.

In this workshop we aim to bring together experts working in the field, review observations and their interpretation, and identify the possible ways forward.

## Satellite talks

While the schedule of the workshop will be tight, we welcome interested colleagues to deliver a *satellite talk*.
These are talks—either live or prerecorded—that we announce to the registered participants, and that we will use in guiding the discussion.

You may either register for a talk directly using the [Speakers' corner](speakers-corner.md) seminar series, share with us a YouTube link, or a recording that we would then post on the Virtual Science Forum YouTube channel

To let us know about your plan to give a talk, send us an [email](mailto://arqh2021@virtualscienceforum.org).
