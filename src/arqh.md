A combination of superconductivity with quantum Hall effect allows perfectly nonlocal crossed Andreev reflection, which has made it a target of experimental search for more than a decade.

Due to progress in material physics and emergence of new hybrid platforms, this search has resulted in a series of
experiments observing a combined effect of chiral edge states and superconductivity.
At the same time, measurements of Andreev conductance in the quantum Hall regime demonstrate wildly different behaviors,
sometimes in disagreement with existing theoretical predictions.

In this workshop we aim to bring together experts working in the field, review observations and their interpretation, and identify the possible ways forward.

## Satellite talks

We welcome interested colleagues to deliver a *satellite talk* on closely related topics.
We will announce these talks to all participants and use them in guiding the discussion.
To let us know about your plan to give a talk, send us an [email](mailto:arqh2021@virtualscienceforum.org).
Then you may either:

- register to give a talk in the [Speakers' Corner](speakers-corner.md) seminar series
- share a YouTube link
- send us a recording

We will include the satellite talks in the workshop webpage.
