# Superconductors + quantum Hall systems: state of the union 2021

A combination of superconductivity with quantum Hall effect allows to produce perfectly 
nonlocal crossed Andreev reflection, which made it a target of experimental search going on for more than a decade.

Due to the progress in material physics and emergence of new hybrid platforms, this search resulted in a series of
experiments observing a combined effect of chiral edge states and superconductivity.
At the same time, measurements of Andreev conductance in the quantum Hall regime demonstrate wildly different behaviors,
sometimes in disagreement with existing theoretical predictions.

In this workshop we aim to bring together experts working in the field, review observations and their interpretation, and identify the possible ways forward.
