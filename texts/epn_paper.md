## Introduction

With the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic researchers turn to online conferencing. While posing new challenges, this format also brings multiple advantages. We argue that virtual conferences will become part of our regular scientific communication and invite the community members to join the action.

<!-- #### COVID lockdown disrupted everyone's work, travel, and likely mean that you attended an online talk. -->

Your routine has changed drastically over the course of the last couple of months due to the lockdowns following the novel coronavirus outbreak.
You now mostly stay at home, hopefully safe and healthy.
Your classes are now taught online, and you probably had to quickly figure out how to run them at all.
If you do experiments, your lab is either closed or operates at a much lower capacity.
Your travel plans are cancelled. Still, despite all this, you have likely attended a scientific presentation or have even given one yourself.
The only difference is that it happened online, perhaps as part of a virtual conference.

<!-- #### Online talks were gaining momentum already before, and for a good reason. -->

Virtual conferences were gaining momentum even before the coronavirus crisis due to multiple advantages over traditional in-person gatherings.
With the increasing concerns about greenhouse emissions, many prefer to limit their long-distance travel.
For some community members with limited mobility, either for family, health, or budget reasons, traditional conferences are off limits altogether, and online events are the only available option.
Online events are also free from most of the expensive and time-consuming aspects of conference organisation: finding a venue, arranging lodging and catering for the participants.
With planning and logistics out of the way, virtual conferences can be organized much faster and can easily respond to the latest scientific developments (see a comparison of typical timelines in the figure).
Because of being easier to attend and accommodating hundreds of participants, online events are also more inclusive, and reach an even broader audience if the talks are recorded.

<!-- #### We decided to develop online conferences and established VSF. -->

The idea of organizing virtual conferences brought us together—a group of geographically and academically diverse physics researchers.
We started exploring the opportunities and challenges of online conferences in late Summer 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic.
We decided to keep our organization open for anyone to join, and all of our documentation and notes were public from the very beginning, with the thought that these should benefit anyone trying to work towards the same goal.
After several discussions we committed to developing a community platform for online conferences, which we now call the [Virtual Science Forum](https://virtualscienceforum.org).

<!-- #### In thinking about online events we had to revisit many assumptions about conferences. -->

Once we started brainstorming how to organize online events, we realized that a lot of usual assumptions about scientific meetings do not apply anymore.
Already the sizes of the events are very different: while a typical workshop will have anywhere between 50 and 100 participants, an online conference session can easily attract 500 attendees.
The duration of an online event is limited to a few hours because it needs to fit into the daily routines of participants spread across multiple hour zones, as opposed to the median duration of a conference being a full working week.
The interactions during the session are also very different: the speaker cannot see the audience and therefore gets very little immediate feedback due to being unable to gauge the audience's reactions.
Because mediating the interaction between the audience and the speaker becomes much more important, and because of the larger audience size, the moderators play a more important role in ensuring that everything goes smoothly.
Finally, offline conferences allow ample time for informal discussion between the talks and during coffee breaks: this valuable aspect of scientific meetings needs to be accommodated separately.

<!-- #### We ran a couple of events, and saw that they work well. -->

To help the community members orient themselves in a new setting, we prepared basic guidelines for all online event participants: organizers, moderators, speakers, and audience members.
Once we felt sufficiently confident, we ran a trial workshop with our direct colleagues as both speakers and the audience.
We used this test run to try out different formats of interaction between the audience and the speaker, check out unexpected technical problems, and collect the impressions from a broader group of colleagues.
More importantly, however, we observed that videoconferencing has now matured to accommodate high quality live talks, where every viewer gets the front row experience.
With this experience we were ready to hit the ground running and managed to organize a virtual session only a few days after the cancellation of the APS March Meeting.
Now we are continuing to work in a steady pace: we improve the platform and organize a biweekly colloquium series.
We also actively invite community initiatives for organizing virtual conferences using our platform, and we are excited to already have the first of such conference applications in progress.
Our experience with organizing online conferences and colloquia has shown that they provide a stimulating environment and foster fruitful discussions.

<!-- #### We are confident that we will see an explosive growth of online events. -->

With more and more people getting used to online meetings and seminars—and with online conferencing software continually improving—we expect that online events become commonplace. 
Our effort towards online conferences was not the first and is certainly no longer one of few.
Online colloquia and seminars are now organized by many science departments and research institutes.
Virtual workshops and conferences are also on the rise.
Emerging organizations like [researchseminars.org](https://researchseminars.org) aggregate the information and distribute announcements in order to help navigate the rapidly growing volume of online events.

<!-- #### You should definitely get involved in the online events, and we are here to help. -->

> **We conclude with a call to action: give virtual conferences a shot!**

Online conferencing is emerging right now because there are no alternatives until the pandemic is over, lockdowns are lifted, and travel is restored.
While our hand is currently forced, we hope that the research community will grow accustomed to this long overdue change and will see the value of virtual conferences in their own right.
This is why we conclude with a call to action: give virtual conferences a shot!
Start with attending the events you like: it has never been easier.
Or perhaps you have an idea for a good event to run?
In that case, now is your chance: go for it, and know that we are here to help.
