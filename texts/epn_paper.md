# Let's talk online

#### COVID lockdown disrupted everyone's work, travel, and likely mean that you attended an online talk.

Your routine changed drastically over the course of the last couple of months due to the lockdowns. You now mostly stay at homeâ€”hopefully safe and healthy. Your classes are now online, and probably you had to quickly figure out how run them at all. If you do experiments, your lab is either closed or operates at a much lower capacity. Your travel plans are cancelled. Still, despite that, you have likely attended a scientific presentation or even gave one yourself. The only difference is that it happened online.

#### Online talks were gaining momentum already before, and for a good reason.
Online events were gaining momentum even before the crisis hit.
There are several advantages of virtual conferences over conventional, in-person gatherings.
With the increasing concerns about greenhouse emissions, many prefer limiting long-distance travel.
For those with limited mobility, either for family or health reasons, they are much easier to attend.
Most of the expensive and time-consuming aspects of conference organisation, such as finding a venue, lodging and catering for the participants are gone, allowing faster turnaround in disseminating new results.

#### We decided to develop online conferences and established VSF.
These issues weighed on all of us, but few outlets existed to relieve them. 
After finding each other as like-minded individuals with an urge to make a difference, we started gathering in the late summer of 2019 to explore our options. 
It quickly became clear that we had the capacity to establish a venue for virtual conferencing. 
So, we committed ourselves to develop this idea into a real platform, which we now call the Virtual Science Forum.

#### In thinking about online events we had to revisit many assumptions about conferences.

As we started to organize ourselves, it became clear quickly that in order to achieve our goals, we needed to revisit our assumptions about online events. For example, the interactions between the speaker and the audience as well as among the audience themselves in an online event are quite different and much less spontaneous. The coffee break, such a natural part of in-person conferences, does not function effectively in an online event to spark discussions. Likewise, the length of an online event is constraint by very different factors, such as the spread of timezones and local commitments and distractions of the participants.

#### We ran a couple of events, and saw that they work well.

We created toolkits and developed strategies and guidelines to navigate these challenges. And we got to work to organize online events, starting with a beta test workshop in December 2019. We learned in real time about challenges of coordinating live questions, addressing technical glitches, and giving feedback to the audience and the speaker. More importantly, however, we were impressed by the quality of the event and the possibility of creative ways of engagement in an online event. For example, "watching parties" with a number of people attending as a group was effective in producing local discussions that were then shared online. And one of our speakers guided the audience through the technical parts of their talk using live code.

With this groundwork in place, we were ready to hit the ground running and help organize our [inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqJ4D_Db7W_p4VRe9MEwCkYyNUC8rEKkG) when the APS March Meeting was cancelled in March 2020 due to the pandemic. We are now organizing the biweekly [VSF Long Range Colloquium](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqJ4D_Db7W_p5KNu8yDhoGyY36g75z3p2) series. We are also excited to have our first conference application already, and look forward to engaging more community initiatives to use our platform. Our experience shows that, with a fresh perspective, online conferences can work well to bring researchers together and communicate their work effectively.


#### We are confident that we will see an explosive growth of online events.

Organization of different types of event has shown us that online conferences, workshops and colloquia provide stimulating environment for a worthwhile scientific event filled with interesting talks and fruitful discussion. Combined with the broad and easy accessibility, improved software options and overall emphasis on lowering the carbon emissions we can only expect further growth of online events. While the recent public health situation has pushed us toward creating new avenues to establish effective online communications, the advantages and engagement we are seeing go well beyond the crisis situations. Broad adoption of online events will lead to increased interconnectedness and accessibility of science in general.


#### Because of how easy it is, many are working towards this goal.

#### You should definitely get involved in the online events, and we are here to help.
