# Let's talk online

#### COVID lockdown disrupted everyone's work, travel, and likely mean that you attended an online talk.

Your routine changed drastically over the course of the last couple of months due to the lockdowns. You now mostly stay at homeâ€”hopefully safe and healthy. Your classes are now online, and probably you had to quickly figure out how run them at all. If you do experiments, your lab is either closed or operates at a much lower capacity. Your travel plans are cancelled. Still, despite that, you have likely attended a scientific presentation or even gave one yourself. The only difference is that it happened online.

#### Online talks were gaining momentum already before, and for a good reason.
Online events were gaining momentum even before the crisis hit.
There are several advantages of virtual conferences over conventional, in-person gatherings.
With the increasing concerns about greenhouse emissions, many prefer limiting long-distance travel.
For those with limited mobility, either for family or health reasons, they are much easier to attend.
Most of the expensive and time-consuming aspects of conference organisation, such as finding a venue, lodging and catering for the participants are gone, allowing faster turnaround in disseminating new results.

#### We decided to develop online conferences and established VSF.

#### In thinking about online events we had to revisit many assumptions about conferences.

As we started to organize ourselves, it became clear quickly that in order to achieve our goals, we needed to revisit our assumptions about online events. For example, the interactions between the speaker and the audience as well as among the aduence are quite different and much less spontaneous in an online event. The coffee break, such a natural part of in-person conferences, does not function effectively in an online event to spark discussions. Likewise, the length of an online event is constraint by very different factors, such as the spread of timezones and local commitments and distractions of the participants.

#### We ran a couple of events, and saw that they work well.

We created toolkits and developed strategies and guidelines to navigate these challenges. And we got to work to organize online events, starting with a beta test workshop in December 2019. We learned in real time about challenges of coordinating live questions, addressing technial glitches, and giving feedback to the audience and the speaker. More importantly, we were impressed by the quality of the event and the possiblity of createive ways of engagement in an online event. For example, "watching parties" with a number of people attending as a group was effective in producing local discussions that were then shared online. And one of our speakers guided the audience through the technical parts of their talk using live code.

With this experience, we were ready to hit the ground and help organize our inaugural event when the APS March Meeting was cancelled in March 2020. We are now organizing the biweekly VSF Long Range Colloquium series. And we are excited to have our first conference application already. //need a bit more meat here// This experience shows, looked through fresh eyes, online conferences can work well to bring resesrchers together to commnuicate their work effectively.


#### We are confident that we will see an explosive growdth of online events.


#### Because of how easy it is, many are working towards this goal.

#### You should definitely get involved in the online events, and we are here to help.
