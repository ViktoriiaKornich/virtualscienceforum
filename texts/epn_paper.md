# Let's talk online

#### COVID lockdown disrupted everyone's work, travel, and likely mean that you attended an online talk.

Your routine changed drastically over the course of the last couple of months due to the lockdowns. You now mostly stay at homeâ€”hopefully safe and healthy. Your classes are now online, and probably you had to quickly figure out how run them at all. If you do experiments, your lab is either closed or operates at a much lower capacity. Your travel plans are cancelled. Still, despite that, you have likely attended a scientific presentation or even gave one yourself. The only difference is that it happened online.

#### Online talks were gaining momentum already before, and for a good reason.
> List some of those reasons

#### We decided to develop online conferences and established VSF.

#### In thinking about online events we had to revisit many assumptions about conferences.
> Some typical challenges (speaker audience interaction), coffee break anyone?

#### We ran a couple of events, and saw that they work well.

#### We are confident that we will see an explosive growdth of online events.

#### Because of how easy it is, many are working towards this goal.

#### You should definitely get involved in the online events, and we are here to help.
