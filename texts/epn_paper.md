# Let's talk online

#### COVID lockdown disrupted everyone's work, travel, and likely mean that you attended an online talk.

Your routine changed drastically over the course of the last couple of months due to the lockdowns. You now mostly stay at homeâ€”hopefully safe and healthy. Your classes are now online, and probably you had to quickly figure out how run them at all. If you do experiments, your lab is either closed or operates at a much lower capacity. Your travel plans are cancelled. Still, despite that, you have likely attended a scientific presentation or even gave one yourself. The only difference is that it happened online.

#### Online talks were gaining momentum already before, and for a good reason.
Online events were gaining momentum even before the crisis hit.
There are several advantages of virtual conferences over conventional, in-person gatherings.
With the increasing concerns about greenhouse emissions, many prefer limiting long-distance travel.
For those with limited mobility, either for family or health reasons, they are much easier to attend.
Most of the expensive and time-consuming aspects of conference organisation, such as finding a venue, lodging and catering for the participants are gone, allowing faster turnaround in disseminating new results.

#### We decided to develop online conferences and established VSF.

#### In thinking about online events we had to revisit many assumptions about conferences.

As we started to organize ourselves, it became clear quickly that in order to achieve our goals, we needed to revisit our assumptions about online events. For example, the interactions between the speaker and the audience as well as among the aduence are quite different and much less spontaneous in an online event. The coffee break, such a natural part of in-person conferences, does not function effectively in an online event to spark discussions. Likewise, the length of an online event is constraint by very different factors, such as the spread of timezones and local commitments and distractions of the participants.

#### We ran a couple of events, and saw that they work well.

#### We are confident that we will see an explosive growdth of online events.

#### Because of how easy it is, many are working towards this goal.

#### You should definitely get involved in the online events, and we are here to help.
