Hello, my name is **** and I'll be your host and moderator today. Thank you for joining us today
for our third presentation in the Long Range Colloquium organized by the Virtual Science Forum. 
A quick intro, if this is your first time joining us, the Virtual Science Forum is an open, collaborative, 
and volunteer-run initiative to facilitate online scientific seminars. If you would like to help 
this effort by joining our group, organizing a session, or suggest speakers, please visit our web page, 
where you can find information and resources about how to do so. All of our content is available on 
Github and on our YouTube channel. Also, our next colloquium on **** is going to be by **** of ****.  
I have shared links to these pages in the chat. I'd also like to thank the institutional support making 
it possible for us to continue this work, in particular the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft.

A note on Q&A: please use the "raise hand" option in the participant panel, which you can find at the 
bottom of your screens. I will be moderating the participants panel and will let the speaker know that 
there is a question from the audience. I will then unmute you to ask your question live.

Ok, let's move to our colloquium today, which presented by **** of ****. She/He will tell us about *****.
