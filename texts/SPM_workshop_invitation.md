Dear Colleagues and Friends, 

We hope this message finds you well. With conferences and events cancelled, we thought that organizing a virtual workshop on scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy would be a good way to keep in touch with our community, stay up to date on the latest results and have some fruitful discussions. We would very much like to see you there!

**The workshop will be held on Thursday, June 18th, 9:00 - 13:00   CEST on Zoom**

We will have three invited talks given by Taeyoung Choi, Katharina Franke and Jascha Repp, followed by a live poster session with a Zoom discussion for each poster.

You can find the details of the event on our website (https://sites.google.com/view/virtualspm). The event is organized with support from the Virtual Science Forum (https://virtualscienceforum.org/#/). Attendance is free, but donâ€™t forget to REGISTER (https://sites.google.com/view/virtualspm/registration ).

Please spread the voice and feel free to forward this message to whoever you think might be interested.

We are looking forward to (virtually) seeing you on June 18th!

Best wishes,
The organizing committee
