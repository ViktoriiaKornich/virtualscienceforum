Dear %recipient_name%,

With support from the Virtual Science Forum, we are organizing a virtual workshop on scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
With this event we aim to stay up to date on the latest results in the field and have fruitful discussions.
The workshop will have three invited talks given by Taeyoung Choi, Katharina Franke and Jascha Repp, followed by a live poster session with a separate Zoom discussion for each poster (everyone welcome to participate).

The workshop will be held Thursday, June 18th, 9:00–13:00 CEST on Zoom. All the details of the event and its program are on the [workshop website](https://sites.google.com/view/virtualspm).
Attendance is free, but don’t forget to [register](https://sites.google.com/view/virtualspm/registration).

We would very much like to see you there!

Please feel free to forward this message to whoever you think might be interested.

We are looking forward to (virtually) seeing you on June 18th!

Best wishes,  
The Virtual Science Forum team, on behalf of the organizing committee:

Fabio Donati, Ewha Womans University  
Fabian Natterer, University of Zurich  
Giulia Pacchioni, Nature Reviews Materials
