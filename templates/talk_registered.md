Please read it carefully and confirm that everything is clear.  
Good luck with your talk!

## Before your meeting

  **Confirm that you received the meeting key and URL by responding to this email.**
- Install a Zoom client (this is required for registration-only meetings).
- Test your setup on your own, check that your sound, video, and slide-sharing work.
- Announce the meeting to your colleagues: you know best who may be interested.

## During the meeting

- The meeting will be open for joining 5 minutes before the talk starts. Join at that time (don't be late!).
- Join using the personal link we sent.
- Claim meeting host by using the host key that is in your email.

- Aim for a 40 minute presentation followed by 15 minutes discussion.
    - If there is another Speakers' Corner talk right after your talk, your meeting will be shut down after 55 minutes.
    - If there isn't, you are free to use your time for up to 2 hours.

## After the meeting

- Once the recording is ready, we share a link to it and ask for your approval.
