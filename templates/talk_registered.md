We've added your talk to the schedule :tada:!

Below please find a checklist for your presentation.  
Please read it carefully and confirm that everything is clear by adding a comment to this issue.  
Also reply here if you have any questions or problems.
Good luck with your talk!

## Before your meeting

- We will send you an email containing the meeting key and your join URL in a moment.
  **Confirm that you received the meeting key and URL by responding in this issue.**
- Install a [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download). This is required to claim host.
- Test your setup on your own: check that your sound, video, and slide-sharing work.
- **Announce the meeting to your colleagues and invite them to register for the talk**.
- We will include your talk in the VSF mailing list announcement. If you like you can also tweet at @VirtualSciForum with the hashtag #VSFSpeakersCorner and we will retweet information about your talk.

## During the meeting

- The meeting will be open for joining 5 minutes before the talk starts. Join at that time using the personal link we sent (don't be late!). 
- Ensure that your screen resolution is 1920x1080 or lower; otherwise, the speaker's video will be too small in the recording. 
- **Claim meeting host by using the host key that is in your email.** (You won't be able to use screenshare otherwise)
- The recording starts automatically as soon as you join. Don't stop it; you may pause it, but don't forget to unpause.
- Tell your audience how the questions will be organized. Can they ask questions during the talk or only at the end? How should they signal they have a question?
- Start your presentation.
- Aim for a 40 minute presentation followed by 15 minutes discussion. You may go over time, but your meeting will be stopped after one hour and a half.

## After the meeting

- Once the recording is ready, we share a link to it and ask for your approval. 
- Once approved, the recording will be published at [the Speakers' Corner YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQEx4iW7u_x3jX742kUZLw)
