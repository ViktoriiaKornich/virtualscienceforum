I've added your talk to the schedule :tada:!

Below please find a checklist for your presentation.  
Please read it carefully and confirm that everything is clear.  
Good luck with your talk!

## Before your meeting

- We will send you an email containing the meeting key and your join URL in a moment.
  **Confirm that you received by responding here.**
- Install a Zoom client (this is required for registration-only meetings)
- Test your setup on your own, check that your sound, video, and slide sharing works
- Announce the meeting to your colleagues: you know best who may be interested

## During the meeting

- The meeting will be open for joining around 5 minutes before the talk starts, join then (don't be late)
- Join using the personal link we sent
- Claim meeting host by using the host key that is in your email
- Start your presentation
- Start the cloud recording by pressing the "record" button. **Important: don't use the "record to my computer* option.**
- Aim for a 40 minute presentation followed by 15 minutes discussion.
    - If there is another Speakers' Corner talk right after your talk, your
      meeting will be shut down after 55 minutes
    - If there isn't, you are free to use your time for up to 2 hours

## After the meeting

- Once the recording is ready, we share a link to it and ask for your approval
