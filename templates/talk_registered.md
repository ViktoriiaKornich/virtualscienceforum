We've added your talk to the schedule :tada:!

Below please find a checklist for your presentation.  
Please read it carefully and confirm that everything is clear by adding a comment to this issue.  
Good luck with your talk!

## Before your meeting

- We will send you an email containing the meeting key and your join URL in a moment.
  **Confirm that you received the meeting key and URL by responding in this issue.**
- Install a [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download). This is required for registration-only meetings.
- Test your setup on your own: check that your sound, video, and slide-sharing work.
- **Announce the meeting to your colleagues and invite them to register for the talk**.
- We will include your talk in the VSF mailing list announcement. If you like you can also tweet at @VirtualSciForum with the hashtag #VSFSpeakersCorner and we will retweet information about your talk.

## During the meeting

- The meeting will be open for joining 5 minutes before the talk starts. Join at that time using the personal link we sent (don't be late!).
- Claim meeting host by using the host key that is in your email.
- The recording starts automatically as soon as you join. Don't stop it; you may pause it, but don't forget to unpause.
- Tell your audience how the questions will be organized. Can they ask questions during the talk or only at the end? How should they signal they have a question?
- Start your presentation.
- Aim for a 40 minute presentation followed by 15 minutes discussion.
    - If another Speakers' Corner talk is scheduled immediately after your talk, your meeting will be shut down at 55 minutes on the hour.
    - If there isn't, you are free to use your time for up to 2 hours.

## After the meeting

- Once the recording is ready, we share a link to it and ask for your approval. 
- Once approved, the recording will be published at [the Speakers' Corner YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQEx4iW7u_x3jX742kUZLw)
