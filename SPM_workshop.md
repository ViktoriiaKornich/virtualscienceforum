Virtual SMP is a free online workshop on recent advances in scanning probe techniques, in particular low-temperature UHV scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.

With three invited talks, discussion time and a live poster session to provide further opportunity to share ideas and results, we hope this event will bring the community together to discuss the latest advances and keep sharing results despite the current lack of in-person conferences. Registration will open soon, stay tuned!

## Program

9:00    Welcome

9:10    **Yosoo Kim** , RIKEN (Japan)

9:55    **Katharina Franke**, FU Berlin (Germany)  
        **Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of organic molecules on single-layer MoS2 on Au(111)**  
        Nils Krane, GaÃ«l Reecht, Christian Lotze, Katharina Franke  
        Adsorption of organic molecules on metal surfaces typically leads to strong hybridization of the frontier molecular orbitals             with the substrate electronic bands. This results in broad energy levels reflecting the ultrashort lifetime of excited molecular         states in tunneling experiments. A monolayer of MoS2 is direct-bandgap semiconductor. Here, we show that single-layer MoS2 on           Au(111) acts as an efficient decoupling layer for organic molecules. The decoupling efficiency is superior to frequently                 employed ionic layers such as NaCl, or to graphene. Molecular resonances within the semiconducting band gap of MoS2 exhibit             widths of only a few meV. This exquisite energy resolution allows to study vibrational excitations within the individual                 molecules. Details in the set of vibronic resonances on thienothiophene-based molecules allow for their rotamer identification.         The spatial intensity distribution along the molecule further reveals that the simple Franck-Condon picture is insufficient for         a complete understanding of the excitation mechanism.

11:25 - 11:45 Break

11:45 Poster session

## Poster session

Format
- Each poster presenter will have their own Zoom link leading to the discussion room for their poster
- Poster presenters are encouraged to send a 1-min video briefly explaining the content of their poster. Both the video and the poster will be available outside of the discussion room for attendees to see, so that the Zoom conversation can be focused on questions
- The poster session will be divided in two 40-min parts to ensure all presenters will also have the opportunity to look at posters

Guidelines for poster preparation
- Keep your poster simple, so people can look at it easily on their screen. Use a horizontal template (set max file size).
- Make a short video (1 min) to present the your poster. 
- Create your Zoom link. Don't share it on social media to avoid zoombombing: the organizers will send make the links available to all participants.
