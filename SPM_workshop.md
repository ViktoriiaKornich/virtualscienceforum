Virtual SPM is a free online workshop on recent advances in scanning probe techniques, in particular low-temperature UHV scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.

With three invited talks, discussion time and a live poster session to provide further opportunity to share ideas and results, we hope this event will bring the community together to discuss the latest advances and keep sharing results despite the current lack of in-person conferences.

## Program

9:00    Welcome

9:10    **Taeyoung Choi** , IBS Center for Quantum Nanoscience, Seoul (South Korea)

9:55    **Katharina Franke**, FU Berlin (Germany)  

> **Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of organic molecules on single-layer MoS2 on Au(111)**  
> *Nils Krane, GaÃ«l Reecht, Christian Lotze, Katharina Franke*  
> Adsorption of organic molecules on metal surfaces typically leads to strong hybridization of the frontier molecular orbitals with the substrate electronic bands. This results in broad energy levels reflecting the ultrashort lifetime of excited molecular states in tunneling experiments. A monolayer of MoS2 is direct-bandgap semiconductor. Here, we show that single-layer MoS$_2$ on Au(111) acts as an efficient decoupling layer for organic molecules. The decoupling efficiency is superior to frequently employed ionic layers such as NaCl, or to graphene. Molecular resonances within the semiconducting band gap of MoS2 exhibit widths of only a few meV. This exquisite energy resolution allows to study vibrational excitations within the individual molecules. Details in the set of vibronic resonances on thienothiophene-based molecules allow for their rotamer identification. The spatial intensity distribution along the molecule further reveals that the simple Franck-Condon picture is insufficient for a complete understanding of the excitation mechanism.

> **Tunneling microscopy on insulators provides access to out-of-equilibrium charge states**  
> *Laerte L. Patera, Fabian Queck, Philipp Scheuerer, Jascha Repp*  
> Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful tool for the investigation of individual molecules, being able to probe their orbitals with sub-molecular resolution. However, the requirement of a conductive substrate strongly limits the accessible electronic transitions. Conversely, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be extended to insulating substrates, providing structural and electrostatic information. However, electronic states are generally not accessible by AFM. Here we exploit the single-electron sensitivity of AFM [1] in detecting electrostatic forces to establish a novel mode in scanning probe, in which an alternating current instead of a direct current probes the sample. Only a single electron per AFM-cantilever oscillation cycle tunnels between tip and investigated structure back and forth, enabling operation in absence of any conductance of the underlying substrate but still capable of imaging electronic states with Angstrom resolution. Our results unveil the effects of electron-transfer and polaron formation on the single-orbital scale [2].

11:25 - 11:45 Break

11:45 Poster session

## Poster session

Format
- Each poster presenter will have their own Zoom link leading to the discussion room for their poster
- Poster presenters are encouraged to send a 1-min video briefly explaining the content of their poster. Both the video and the poster will be available outside of the discussion room for attendees to see, so that the Zoom conversation can be focused on questions
- The poster session will be divided in two 40-min parts to ensure all presenters will also have the opportunity to look at posters

Guidelines for poster preparation
- Keep your poster simple, so people can look at it easily on their screen. Use a horizontal format (5MB max size).
- Make a short video (1 min) to present the your poster (recommended). 
- Create your Zoom link. Don't share it on social media to avoid zoombombing: the organizers will send make the links available to all participants.
