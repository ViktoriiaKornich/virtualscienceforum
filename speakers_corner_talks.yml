  title: Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite
    bias
  abstract: 'Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions
    is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting
    devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap
    conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and
    unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits
    deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work,
    we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle
    poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include
    the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant
    conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify
    the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible
    mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental
    to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that
    can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source
    of conductance asymmetries.'

  title: Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
  abstract: The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale
    sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting
    fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance
    coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle
    paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist
    for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant
    of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight
    and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's
    theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like
    ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature
    cuprate superconductors.

  title: Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
  abstract: Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken
    spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using
    modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus
    forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires
    precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show
    how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping.
    Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying
    magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion
    that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches
    an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can
    further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled
    dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions
    along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can
    be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

  title: Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
  abstract: Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals
    materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial
    quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological
    matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted
    van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here
    we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging
    from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental
    findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled
    graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy
    physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial
    gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover,
    we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to
    the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can
    be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate
    that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent
    electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

    a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which topological

  title: Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices
  abstract: In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex
    fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed
    as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands
    recurring at rational ($p/q$) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice
    unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak
    fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10$^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and the mean
    free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices
    allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are $4q$ times degenerate and all the
    degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions
    below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at $1/q$ fractions for electrical
    probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights
    the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high
    fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.

  title: Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard
    model
  abstract: The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces
    that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic
    (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems
    with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially
    small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating
    has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically
    driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is
    beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical
    description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate
    to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an
    analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong
    interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution
    of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments
    to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems.

  title: Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking
  abstract: Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based
    topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional topological
    superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting
    state. However, no interacting one-dimensional many-body system is known to spontaneously
    break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system
    without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In
    particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting
    state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating
    that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking.
    We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of
    the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We introduce
    a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state
    analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in
    a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes
    may appear in a many-body systems without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing
    a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs.

  title: Electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowires
  abstract: We study the electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al heterostructures as
    explored in a recent experiment [S. Vaitiekenas \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2020)],
    combining both spectroscopic results and microscopic device simulations. In particular,
    we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band bending
    at the InAs/EuS interface. The resulting band offset value serves as an essential
    input to subsequent microscopic device simulations, allowing us to map the electronic
    wave function distribution. We conclude that the magnetic proximity effects at
    the Al/EuS as well as the InAs/EuS interfaces are both essential to achieve topological
    superconductivity at zero applied magnetic field. Mapping the topological phase
    diagram as a function of gate voltages and proximity-induced exchange couplings,
    we show that the ferromagnetic hybrid nanowire with overlapping Al and EuS layers
    can become a topological superconductor within realistic parameter regimes. Our
    work highlights the need for a combined experimental and theoretical effort for
    faithful device simulation.

  title: Topological phonons in oxide perovskites controlled by light
  abstract: Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting
    different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications.
    We find that topological phonons – nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points –
    are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic,
    and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and external conditions
    (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase
    of these compounds all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge
    when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by
    thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states.
    In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to
    tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without
    associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as
    a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation
    with light.

  title: Strain-engineering the topological type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2
  abstract: In this work, the electronic and elastic properties of the type-II Dirac
    semimetal NiTe$_2$, in equilibrium and under strain, were systematically studied
    within the scope of density functional theory (DFT) and effective models. We have
    demonstrated that strain-engineering is an effective route for manipulating its
    electronic and topological properties. We have shown that compressive and tensile
    deformations control the Dirac node momentum and their energy relative to the
    Fermi level. Moreover, it is possible to lower or increase the overlap between
    the low-energy wave functions and suppress trivial bands, opening the way for
    superconductivity, Liftshtz transitions, and a hybrid type-I and type-II Dirac
    semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we provided a minimal effective model for the
    Dirac cone and derive the mentioned strain effects using lattice regularization,
    providing an inexpensive way for further theoretical investigations and easy comparison
    with experiments. We also proposed statically controlling the electronic-structure
    with the intercalation of alkali-element species into the van der Waals gap, resulting
    in a similar physical response to the one obtained by strain-engineering.

  title: Floquet Gauge Pump
  abstract: We introduce the concept of a Floquet gauge pump whereby a dynamically
    engineered Floquet Hamiltonian is employed to reveal the inherent degeneracy of
    the ground state in interacting systems. We demonstrate this concept in a one-dimensional
    XY model with periodically driven couplings and transverse field. In the high
    frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static XY
    and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically
    generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms,
    with the XY interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases
    are cycled, it reveals the ground state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered
    and disordered phases. We discuss experimental requirements needed to realize
    the Floquet gauge pump in a synthetic quantum spin system of interacting trapped
    ions.
