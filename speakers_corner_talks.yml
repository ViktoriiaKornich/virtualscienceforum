  title: "Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to\n \
    \ finite bias"
  abstract: "Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions\n\
    is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic\nsuperconducting\
    \ devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal\nsuperconducting device, the\
    \ subgap conductance obeys specific symmetry\nrelations, due to particle-hole\
    \ symmetry and unitarity of the scattering\nmatrix. However, experimental data\
    \ often exhibits deviations from these\nsymmetries or even their explicit breakdown.\
    \ In this work, we identify a\nmechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries\
    \ without quasiparticle\npoisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects\
    \ of finite bias and include\nthe voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency,\
    \ finding significant\nconductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters.\
    \ It is important to\nidentify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries:\
    \ in contrast to other\npossible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias\
    \ effects are\nnot detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that\
    \ end we\nidentify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether\n\
    finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries."
