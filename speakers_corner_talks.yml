  title: Weyl Josephson Circuits
  abstract: "We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits\
    \ that\nsimulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to\
    \ design\ncircuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality\n\
    and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that\n\
    produces a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which\ntopological\
    \ phase transitions can be triggered \\emph{in situ}. We argue that\ncurrently\
    \ available superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that\nprobe\
    \ topological properties inaccessible in condensed matter systems."

  title: Hybrid kernel polynomial method
  abstract: "The kernel polynomial method allows to sample overall spectral properties\
    \ of\na quantum system, while sparse diagonalization provides accurate information\n\
    about a few important states. We present a method combining these two\napproaches\
    \ without loss of performance or accuracy. We apply this hybrid kernel\npolynomial\
    \ method to improve the computation of thermodynamic quantities and\nthe construction\
    \ of perturbative effective models, in a regime where neither of\nthe methods\
    \ is sufficient on its own. To achieve this we develop a perturbative\nkernel\
    \ polynomial method to compute arbitrary order series expansions of\nexpectation\
    \ values. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three\nexamples: the\
    \ calculation of supercurrent and inductance in a Josephson\njunction, the interaction\
    \ of spin qubits defined in a two dimensional electron\ngas, and the calculation\
    \ of the effective band structure in a realistic model\nof a semiconductor nanowire."
