  title: Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite
    bias
  abstract: 'Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions
    is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting
    devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap
    conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and
    unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits
    deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work,
    we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle
    poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include
    the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant
    conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify
    the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible
    mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental
    to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that
    can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source
    of conductance asymmetries.'

  title: Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
  abstract: The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale
    sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting
    fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance
    coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle
    paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist
    for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant
    of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight
    and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's
    theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like
    ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature
    cuprate superconductors.

  title: Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
  abstract: Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken
    spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using
    modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus
    forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires
    precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show
    how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping.
    Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying
    magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion
    that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches
    an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can
    further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled
    dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions
    along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can
    be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

  title: Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
  abstract: Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals
    materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial
    quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological
    matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted
    van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here
    we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging
    from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental
    findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled
    graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy
    physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial
    gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover,
    we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to
    the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can
    be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate
    that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent
    electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

  title: Topological Band Structures in the Offset-Parameter-Dependence of Small Josephson
    Circuits
  abstract: 'We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits
    that simulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to design
    circuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality
    and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that produces
    a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which topological
    phase transitions can be triggered *in situ*. We argue that currently available
    superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that probe topological properties
    inaccessible in condensed matter systems.'

  title: Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices
  abstract: In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex
    fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed
    as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands
    recurring at rational ($p/q$) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice
    unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak
    fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10$^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and the mean
    free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices
    allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are $4q$ times degenerate and all the
    degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions
    below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at $1/q$ fractions for electrical
    probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights
    the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high
    fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.

  title: Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard
    model
  abstract: The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces
    that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic
    (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems
    with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially
    small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating
    has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically
    driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is
    beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical
    description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate
    to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an
    analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong
    interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution
    of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments
    to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems.
