  title: Weyl Josephson Circuits
  abstract: "We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits\
    \ that\nsimulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to\
    \ design\ncircuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality\n\
    and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that\n\
    produces a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which\ntopological\
    \ phase transitions can be triggered \\emph{in situ}. We argue that\ncurrently\
    \ available superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that\nprobe\
    \ topological properties inaccessible in condensed matter systems."
