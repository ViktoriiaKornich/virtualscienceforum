#### From Materials to Cosmology: Studying the early universe under the microscope

Uncovering the behavior of the early universe just after the Big Bang is an intriguing fundamental activity that is extraordinarily difficult because of insurmountable issues associated with replaying the Big Bang in the laboratory.  One route to the answer—which lies at the intersection between cosmology and materials science—is to use laboratory materials to test the laws proposed for the formation of defects such as cosmic strings in the early universe. Here I will show that a popular multiferroic material, hexagonal yttrium manganite—with its coexisting magnetic, ferroelectric and structural phase transitions—generates the crystallographic equivalent of cosmic strings. I will describe how straightforward solution of the Schroedinger equation for yttrium manganite allows the important features of its behavior to be identified and quantified, and present experimental results of what seem to be the first unambiguous demonstration of the expected cosmological scaling laws in a real material. I will end with a plea for help with imaging the multiferroic "cosmic strings", and show some recent data suggesting that things might be less unambiguous than they seem.

#### Quantum interactions with pulses of radiation

How does a quantum system interact with a travelling pulse of quantum radiation, prepared for example in a number state or a coherent state of light? While crucial for multiple effects in quantum optics and for the entire concept of flying and stationary qubits, quantum optics textbooks do not provide a formal description of this foundational and elementary interaction process.  In this lecture, I shall introduce a new (and simple) master equation that describes the joint quantum state of travelling pulses of quantized radiation and local quantum systems. Applications of the theory will be presented for recent experiments with qubits and non-linear resonators interacting with pulses of optical, microwave and acoustic radiation.
