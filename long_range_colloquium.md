#### Charge Transfer Excitations, Pair Density Waves, and Superconductivity in Moiré Materials

Transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers are a new class of tunable Moiré systems attracting interest as quantum simulators of strongly-interacting electrons in two dimensions. In this talk, I will argue that the correlated insulator recently observed in WSe2/WS2 at half filling is a charge-transfer insulator similar to cuprates, in which hole doping induces a charge from anion-like to cation-like orbitals at different locations in the Moiré unit cell [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14061 "Y. Zhang, N. Yuan and L. Fu, arXiv:1910.14061"). Interestingly, at small doping, tightly-bound charge-2e "trimers" consisting of two holes bound to a charge-transfer exciton can form to lower the total electrostatic repulsion [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13690 "K. Slagle and L. Fu, arXiv:2003.13690"). When the bandwidth of doped holes is small, trimers crystallize into insulating pair density waves at a sequence of commensurate doping levels. When the bandwidth becomes comparable to the pair binding energy, itinerant holes and charge-2e trimers interact resonantly, leading to unconventional superconductivity similar to superfluidity in an ultracold Fermi gas near Feshbach resonance.

#### Zero-field Topological Superconductivity in Ferromagnetic Hybrid Nanowires

We report transport measurements and tunneling spectroscopy in hybrid nanowires with epitaxial layers of superconducting Al and the ferromagnetic insulator EuS, grown on semiconducting InAs nanowires. In devices where the Al and EuS covered facets overlap, we infer a remanent effective Zeeman field of order 1 T, and observe stable zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling spectroscopy into the end of the nanowire, consistent with topological superconductivity at zero applied field. Hysteretic features in critical current and tunneling spectra as a function of applied magnetic field support this picture. Nanowires with non-overlapping Al and EuS covered facets do not show comparable features. Topological superconductivity in zero applied field allows new device geometries and types of control.
