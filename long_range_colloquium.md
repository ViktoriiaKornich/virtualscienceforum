#### Zero-field Topological Superconductivity in Ferromagnetic Hybrid Nanowires

We report transport measurements and tunneling spectroscopy in hybrid nanowires with epitaxial layers of superconducting Al and the ferromagnetic insulator EuS, grown on semiconducting InAs nanowires. In devices where the Al and EuS covered facets overlap, we infer a remanent effective Zeeman field of order 1 T, and observe stable zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling spectroscopy into the end of the nanowire, consistent with topological superconductivity at zero applied field. Hysteretic features in critical current and tunneling spectra as a function of applied magnetic field support this picture. Nanowires with non-overlapping Al and EuS covered facets do not show comparable features. Topological superconductivity in zero applied field allows new device geometries and types of control.

### Microscopic evidence for a chiral superconducting order parameter in the heavy fermion superconductor UTe2

Spin-triplet superconductivity is a condensate of electron pairs with spin-1 and an odd-parity wavefunction. A particularly interesting manifestation of triplet pairing is a chiral p-wave state which is topologically non-trivial and a natural platform for realizing Majorana edge modes. Triplet pairing is however rare in solid state systems. The best-known example of chiral spin-triplet paring is the superfluid 3He-A phase and over the last few decades, there has been an intensive search for potential spin-triplet superconductors in solid-state systems. Since pairing is most naturally mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, uranium based heavy fermion systems containing f-electron elements that can harbor both strong correlations and magnetism are considered ideal candidate spin-triplet superconductors. In this work I will present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data on the newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor, UTe2 with a T<sub>SC</sub> of 1.6 K. I will show signatures of coexisting Kondo effect and superconductivity which show competing spatial modulations within one unit-cell.  STM spectroscopy at step edges show signatures of chiral in-gap states, predicted to exist at the boundaries of a topological superconductor. Combined with existing data indicating triplet pairing, the presence of chiral edge states suggests that UTe2 is a strong candidate material for chiral-triplet topological superconductivity.

#### From Materials to Cosmology: Studying the early universe under the microscope

Uncovering the behavior of the early universe just after the Big Bang is an intriguing fundamental activity that is extraordinarily difficult because of insurmountable issues associated with replaying the Big Bang in the laboratory.  One route to the answer -- which lies at the intersection between cosmology and materials science -- is to use laboratory materials to test the laws proposed for the formation of defects such as cosmic strings in the early universe. Here I will show that a popular multiferroic material, hexagonal yttrium manganite -- with its coexisting magnetic, ferroelectric and structural phase transitions -- generates the crystallographic equivalent of cosmic strings. I will describe how straightforward solution of the Schroedinger equation for yttrium manganite allows the important features of its behavior to be identified and quantified, and present experimental results of what seem to be the first unambiguous demonstration of the expected cosmological scaling laws in a real material. I will end with a plea for help with imaging the multiferroic "cosmic strings", and show some recent data suggesting that things might be less unambiguous than they seem.

#### Quantum interactions with pulses of radiation

How does a quantum system interact with a travelling pulse of quantum radiation, prepared for example in a number state or a coherent state of light? While crucial for multiple effects in quantum optics and for the entire concept of flying and stationary qubits, quantum optics textbooks do not provide a formal description of this foundational and elementary interaction process.  In this lecture, I shall introduce a new (and simple) master equation that describes the joint quantum state of travelling pulses of quantized radiation and local quantum systems. Applications of the theory will be presented for recent experiments with qubits and non-linear resonators interacting with pulses of optical, microwave and acoustic radiation.
