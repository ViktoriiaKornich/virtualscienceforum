> #### Strongly interacting electronic states of a moiré superlattice  
>  
>Interactions among electrons or the topology of their energy bands can create novel quantum phases of matter. The discovery of electronic bands with flat energy dispersion in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has created a unique opportunity to search for new correlated and topological electronic phases. From the initial discovery of correlated insulators, superconductivity, and more recent reports of topological phases in various transport studies it is clear that this is a very rich electronic system. To understand the underlying mechanisms for formation of various phases and their properties, we have carried out a series of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) studies of MATBG while tuning its carrier concentration with a gate. Such density-tuned STS studies can reveal a variety of key information that are impossible to obtain from other techniques. For example, in our first study, we showed that while the properties of the flat bands in MATBG can be understood with a weakly interacting picture when they are fully occupied or empty, at partial filling such models fails to understand their spectroscopic properties [1]. In a subsequent study, we showed that within this highly interacting states there are a cascade of transition occurring as a function of carrier density, at each integer filling—where insulating phases form at low temperatures [2]. We understand these transitions as a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions and spin/valley quantum degeneracy of this systems splitting the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard sub-bands. I will describe these studies as well as our ongoing efforts to probe the nature of insulating, topological, and superconducting states In MATBG using millikelvin STM measurements.

> #### Multiple topological facets of Bismuth
>
> Bismuth, due to its large spin-orbit coupling, plays a fundamental role in
> many topological materials. Yet the topological classification of pure Bismuth has
> remained, thus far, rather ambiguous. While some theoretical models indicate its trivial
> topological nature, other theoretical and experimental studies suggest non-trivial
> topological classifications, such as a strong or a higher order topological insulator. I will
> explain the origin for this ambiguity and present scanning tunneling microscopy data in
> which we resolve the topological classification of Bismuth, as a strong topological
> insulator with weak indices, by spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary
> modes to a topological defect in the form of a screw dislocation [1].  Next, I will present
> our work on Bi₂TeI, which consists of a stack of Bi-bilayers. Our data shows that in this
> form the topological nature is of a dual topological insulator [2]. Bi 2 TeI hosts a weak
> topological insulator surface state on its ‘side’ facets and a topological crystalline
> insulator surface state protected by mirror symmetry on its top and bottom facets. We
> visualize the topological crystalline surface states and show their sensitivity to mirror
> symmetry-breaking as well as the one dimensional channels, derived from the 2D weak
> topological insulator states, which run along step-edges. We studied the coexistence of
> the two types of states on step-edges, where both facets join. Our measurements reveal
> that the two types of states remain well decoupled from one another due to separation
> in momentum space and in energy. We show, however, that this protection is
> susceptible to strong disorder.
