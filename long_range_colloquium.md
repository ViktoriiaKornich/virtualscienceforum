> #### Multiple topological facets of Bismuth
>
> Bismuth, due to its large spin-orbit coupling, plays a fundamental role in
> many topological materials. Yet the topological classification of pure Bismuth has
> remained, thus far, rather ambiguous. While some theoretical models indicate its trivial
> topological nature, other theoretical and experimental studies suggest non-trivial
> topological classifications, such as a strong or a higher order topological insulator. I will
> explain the origin for this ambiguity and present scanning tunneling microscopy data in
> which we resolve the topological classification of Bismuth, as a strong topological
> insulator with weak indices, by spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary
> modes to a topological defect in the form of a screw dislocation [1].  Next, I will present
> our work on Bi₂TeI, which consists of a stack of Bi-bilayers. Our data shows that in this
> form the topological nature is of a dual topological insulator [2]. Bi 2 TeI hosts a weak
> topological insulator surface state on its ‘side’ facets and a topological crystalline
> insulator surface state protected by mirror symmetry on its top and bottom facets. We
> visualize the topological crystalline surface states and show their sensitivity to mirror
> symmetry-breaking as well as the one dimensional channels, derived from the 2D weak
> topological insulator states, which run along step-edges. We studied the coexistence of
> the two types of states on step-edges, where both facets join. Our measurements reveal
> that the two types of states remain well decoupled from one another due to separation
> in momentum space and in energy. We show, however, that this protection is
> susceptible to strong disorder.
