  title: Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite
    bias
  abstract: 'Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions
    is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting
    devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap
    conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and
    unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits
    deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work,
    we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle
    poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include
    the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant
    conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify
    the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible
    mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental
    to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that
    can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source
    of conductance asymmetries.'

  title: Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
  abstract: The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale
    sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting
    fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance
    coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle
    paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist
    for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant
    of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight
    and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's
    theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like
    ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature
    cuprate superconductors.

  title: Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
  abstract: Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken
    spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using
    modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus
    forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires
    precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show
    how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping.
    Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying
    magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion
    that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches
    an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can
    further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled
    dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions
    along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can
    be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

  title: Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
  abstract: Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals
    materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial
    quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological
    matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted
    van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here
    we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging
    from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental
    findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled
    graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy
    physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial
    gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover,
    we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to
    the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can
    be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate
    that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent
    electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

  title: Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices
  abstract: In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex
    fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed
    as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands
    recurring at rational ($p/q$) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice
    unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak
    fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10$^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and the mean
    free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices
    allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are $4q$ times degenerate and all the
    degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions
    below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at $1/q$ fractions for electrical
    probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights
    the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high
    fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.

  title: Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard
    model
  abstract: The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces
    that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic
    (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems
    with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially
    small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating
    has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically
    driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is
    beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical
    description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate
    to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an
    analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong
    interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution
    of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments
    to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems.

  title: Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking
  abstract: Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based
    topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional topological
    superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting
    state. However, no interacting one-dimensional many-body system is known to spontaneously
    break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system
    without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In
    particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting
    state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating
    that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking.
    We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of
    the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We introduce
    a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state
    analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in
    a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes
    may appear in a many-body systems without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing
    a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs.

  title: Electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowires
  abstract: We study the electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al heterostructures as
    explored in a recent experiment [S. Vaitiekenas \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2020)],
    combining both spectroscopic results and microscopic device simulations. In particular,
    we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band bending
    at the InAs/EuS interface. The resulting band offset value serves as an essential
    input to subsequent microscopic device simulations, allowing us to map the electronic
    wave function distribution. We conclude that the magnetic proximity effects at
    the Al/EuS as well as the InAs/EuS interfaces are both essential to achieve topological
    superconductivity at zero applied magnetic field. Mapping the topological phase
    diagram as a function of gate voltages and proximity-induced exchange couplings,
    we show that the ferromagnetic hybrid nanowire with overlapping Al and EuS layers
    can become a topological superconductor within realistic parameter regimes. Our
    work highlights the need for a combined experimental and theoretical effort for
    faithful device simulation.

  title: Topological phonons in oxide perovskites controlled by light
  abstract: Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting
    different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications.
    We find that topological phonons – nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points –
    are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic,
    and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and external conditions
    (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase
    of these compounds all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge
    when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by
    thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states.
    In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to
    tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without
    associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as
    a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation
    with light.

  title: Strain-engineering the topological type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2
  abstract: In this work, the electronic and elastic properties of the type-II Dirac
    semimetal NiTe$_2$, in equilibrium and under strain, were systematically studied
    within the scope of density functional theory (DFT) and effective models. We have
    demonstrated that strain-engineering is an effective route for manipulating its
    electronic and topological properties. We have shown that compressive and tensile
    deformations control the Dirac node momentum and their energy relative to the
    Fermi level. Moreover, it is possible to lower or increase the overlap between
    the low-energy wave functions and suppress trivial bands, opening the way for
    superconductivity, Liftshtz transitions, and a hybrid type-I and type-II Dirac
    semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we provided a minimal effective model for the
    Dirac cone and derive the mentioned strain effects using lattice regularization,
    providing an inexpensive way for further theoretical investigations and easy comparison
    with experiments. We also proposed statically controlling the electronic-structure
    with the intercalation of alkali-element species into the van der Waals gap, resulting
    in a similar physical response to the one obtained by strain-engineering.

  title: Floquet Gauge Pump
  abstract: We introduce the concept of a Floquet gauge pump whereby a dynamically
    engineered Floquet Hamiltonian is employed to reveal the inherent degeneracy of
    the ground state in interacting systems. We demonstrate this concept in a one-dimensional
    XY model with periodically driven couplings and transverse field. In the high
    frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static XY
    and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically
    generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms,
    with the XY interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases
    are cycled, it reveals the ground state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered
    and disordered phases. We discuss experimental requirements needed to realize
    the Floquet gauge pump in a synthetic quantum spin system of interacting trapped
    ions.

  title: Bloch-Lorentz magnetoresistance oscillations in delafossites
  abstract: Recent measurements of the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of delafossites
    (PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$) observed oscillations which closely resemble the Aharanov-Bohm
    effect. We develop a semiclassical theory of these oscillations and show that
    they are a consequence of the quasi-2D dispersion of delafossites. We observe
    that the Lorentz force created by an in-plane magnetic field makes the out-of-plane
    motion of electrons oscillatory, similarly to Bloch oscillations. Analysis of
    the visibility of these Bloch-Lorentz oscillations reveals the mean-free path
    to be $l \approx 4.4 \mu m$ in comparison to the literature in-plane mean free
    path of $20 \mu m$. The mean-free path is reduced as a consequence of the out-of-plane
    relaxation and sample wall scattering. Our theory offers a way to design an experimental
    geometry that is better suited for probing the phenomenon and to investigate the
    out-of-plane dynamics of ballistic quasi-two-dimensional materials.

  title: ‌Electrons Bloch-waltzing in Moire superlattices
  abstract: A striking prediction of the quantum theory of solids is that Bloch electrons
    in the presence of a constant electric field oscillate at a frequency tunable
    by the field and taking identical values for all carriers in the band. As a paradigmatic
    example of collective electron dynamics, Bloch oscillations received much attention,
    and yet, achieving this regime in solids proved to be challenging. This talk will
    discuss the new ideas and a new hope triggered by the advent of van der Waals
    heterostructures, in particular the flat bands in Moire graphene. There are several
    interesting not-yet-explored regimes harbored by these systems. One is synchronous
    oscillations of “enlightened” electrons coupled to “the big power in the sky”
    (the EM field of a proximal resonator)—a collective many-body dynamics that holds
    promise for THz electronics. Another is magnetic Bloch oscillations achieved by
    combining constant electric and magnetic fields. The unique dynamical regimes
    arising in this case are described by the Ashcroft-Mermin (AM) Hamiltonian. We
    will demonstrate that the AM dynamics is integrable and identify two distinct
    phases, electric and magnetic, exhibiting position-momentum duality—the orbits
    extended in the $k$ space and confined in the $x$ space, and vice versa. The boundary
    between the electric and magnetic phases hosts an interesting and presently poorly
    understood chaotic dynamical phase. The two phases—electric and magnetic—are of
    keen interest both as examples of complex quantum dynamics arising in a simple
    setting and because of their relevance for THz research.

  title: Orbital magnetism in graphene heterostructures
  abstract: "The earliest reports of ferromagnetism date to Thales of Miletus who\
    \ lived and wrote around 600 BC. Thales noted the ability of natural magnetite\
    \ to attract iron, and is said to have taken this as proof that matter itself\
    \ was alive. Our theories of magnetism have evolved considerably since then: we\
    \ now know that ferromagnetism arises from the interplay of the Coulomb repulsion\
    \ between electrons and their fermionic statistics. However, in one sense our\
    \ science has advanced only little: the vast majority of magnets, like magnetite,\
    \ consist of ordered arrangements of the electron spins stabilized by the spin\
    \ orbit interaction. In my talk, I will describe a new class of magnets based\
    \ on the spontaneous alignment of electron orbitals. Such orbital ferromagnetism\
    \ may be a generic phenomena, but has, to date, found its fullest expression in\
    \ graphene heterostructures in which the two dimensional orbits of electrons in\
    \ distinct momentum space valleys provide the underlying degree of freedom. \r\
    \nBecause orbital degrees of freedom arise directly from the band wavefunctions,\
    \ they are uniquely susceptible to experimental control via materials design.\
    \  Orbital magnets also enable new forms of magnetic control using in situ knobs.\
    \ For instance, orbital magnets in moire superlattice systems, where the band\
    \ structure features nontrivial topology, allow for field-effect switching of\
    \ magnetic moments and the resulting quantized anomalous Hall effects. I will\
    \ conclude with an outlook for realizing more exotic topological phases of matter\
    \ based on orbital magnetism."

  title: Amorphous topological phases protected by continuous rotation symmetry
  abstract: Protection of topological surface states by reflection symmetry breaks
    down when the boundary of the sample is misaligned with one of the high symmetry
    planes of the crystal. We demonstrate that this limitation is removed in amorphous
    topological materials, where the Hamiltonian is invariant on average under reflection
    over any axis due to continuous rotation symmetry. While the local disorder caused
    by the amorphous structure weakens the topological protection, we demonstrate
    that the edge remains protected from localization. In order to classify such phases
    we perform a systematic search over all the possible symmetry classes in two dimensions
    and construct the example models realizing each of the proposed topological phases.
    Finally, we compute the topological invariant of these phases as an integral along
    a meridian of the spherical Brillouin zone of an amorphous Hamiltonian.

  title: Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition
  abstract: The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious
    members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling flow
    close to the critical fixed point in the parameter plane spanned by the longitudinal
    and Hall conductivities has been studied vigorously both by experiments and with
    numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin
    down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details
    and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer [Nucl.
    Phys. B 941, 458 (2019)] has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition,
    in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow
    in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we
    provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations
    of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality,
    we confirm the marginal scaling of the longitudinal conductivity towards the conjectured
    fixed-point value $\sigma_{xx} = 2/\pi$. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism
    that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents $\nu_{eff}$,
    which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We confirm this
    idea by exact numerical determination of $\nu_{eff}$ in suitably chosen models.

    modes in zero spatial dimensions, e.g. quantum dot, with interactions strong enough
    to completely washout quasiparticle excitations in the infrared. In this note,
    we consider the complex-valued SYK model at temperature $T$ coupled to a zero
    temperature reservoir by a quench. We find out that the tunneling current dynamics
    reveals a way to distinguish the SYK non-Fermi liquid (nFL) initial state of the
    subsystem from the disordered Fermi liquid. Temperature dependent contribution
    to the current's half-life scales linearly in $T$ at low temperatures for the
    SYK nFl state, while for the Fermi liquid it scales as $T^2$. This provides a
    characteristic signature of the SYK non-Fermi liquid in a non-equilibrium measurement.

  title: Deconfinement of Majorana vortex modes produces a superconducting Landau
    level
  abstract: A spatially oscillating pair potential $\Delta(r)=\Delta_0 e^{i K\cdot
    x}$ with momentum $K>\Delta_0/\hbar v$ drives a deconfinement transition of the
    Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of a Fu-Kane heterostructure (a 3D topological
    insulator with Fermi velocity $v$, on a superconducting substrate with gap $\Delta_0$,
    in a perpendicular magnetic field). In the deconfined phase at zero chemical potential
    the Majorana fermions form a dispersionless Landau level, protected by chiral
    symmetry against broadening due to vortex scattering. The coherent superposition
    of electrons and holes in the Majorana Landau level is detectable as a local density
    of states oscillation with wave vector $\sqrt{K^2-(\Delta_0/\hbar v)^2}$. The
    striped pattern also provides a means to measure the chirality of the Majorana
    fermions.

  title: Flat band induced non-Fermi liquid behavior of multicomponent fermions
  abstract: We investigate multicomponent fermions in a flat band and predict experimental
    signatures of non-Fermi liquid behavior. We use dynamical mean-field theory to
    obtain the density, double occupancy and entropy in a Lieb lattice for $\mathcal{N}
    = 2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ components. We derive a mean-field scaling relation
    between the results for different values of $\mathcal{N}$, and study its breakdown
    due to beyond-mean field effects. The predicted signatures occur at temperatures
    above the N\'eel temperature and persist in presence of a harmonic trapping potential,
    thus they are observable with current ultracold gas experiments.
