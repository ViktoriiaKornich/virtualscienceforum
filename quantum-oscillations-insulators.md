# Quantum Oscillations in Insulators

In 2015 the Cambridge group reported the mysterious observation of quantum (de Haas-van Alphen) oscillations in the electrically insulating material samarium hexaboride (SmB₆). This finding presented an apparent paradox, since quantum oscillations usually indicate a Fermi surface of electrons, which is at odds with the lack of electrical conduction. This surprising finding kicked off a flurry of activity, including a range of experimental studies of SmB6 and a variety of theories proposing various mechanisms for forming a Fermi surface of charge-neutral quasiparticles. While our understanding of SmB6 as a material has advanced significantly, the central mystery of the origin of the oscillations does not have a consensus solution.

Very recently, however, experiments have uncovered similar phenomenology—quantum oscillations coinciding with electrical insulation—in other materials, including ytterbium boron 12 and tungsten ditelluride. These new observations may be the key to a breakthrough in understanding this phenomenon.

Our workshop aims to bring together the key experimental and theoretical leaders in the question of quantum oscillations in insulators. To our knowledge, there has never been a conference, workshop, or focus session devoted to the topic of quantum oscillations in insulators, and we hope that bringing this community together can help to resolve this prominent scientific mystery.
