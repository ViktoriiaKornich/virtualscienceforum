# Moderator Guide

## Your tasks
 

* open the program by introducing the event, organizers and the (first) speaker
* remind the audience of the event format and explain how and when to ask questions
* monitor the participant list for raised hands and enable those attendees to ask questions
* handle any technical issues with the execution of the virtual conference
* monitor participant behavior in the chat for breaches of the code of conduct
* give a closing remarks.

Below we provide more detailed information on certain aspects of the moderator role. 

## How to

### Opening and closing remarks

At the beginning of the seminar: 

* highlight the speaker’s screen-share,
* introduce the speaker (name, current institution, something about the talk or their current work),
* unmute the speaker and invite them to begin their seminar.

At the end of the seminar: 

* thank the speaker 
* initiate the post-talk question/answer period
* stop highlighting speaker's screen-share.

NB: a virtual conference cannot have applause after the seminar ends! However, Zoom does have a clapping hands image that audience members may put up next to their name in the participants list. 


### Question guidelines

Unless otherwise agreed by the organizers, the following guidelines apply:

* Short talks: after the talk ends.
* Long talks: questions may be asked at any time.

Mediating questions:

* Monitor the participants list to observe attendees signaling for questions (“Raise hand option”).
* Let speaker and audience know that there is a question, and signal the asker by stating their name and unmuting their microphone.
* Leave the attendee unmuted while interacting with the speaker.
* Mute the attendee when finished, and “lower their hand”.
* In the event of a prolonged discussion, you may get the talk back on track by suggesting that the conversation continue separately after the seminar.


### Technical issues

* Speaker-side issues: where possible, try to have a second line of communication with the speakers in case an issue comes up on their end.
* Audience-side issues: attendees are instructed to send chat messages directly to the moderator if technical issues arise on their end, and the moderator must make a judgement call as to whether some kind of action should be taken.

Moderators should report on any such issues (and fixes) to the organizers or the VSF team, and also encourage such feedback from all participants.


### Misconduct

In the event of misconduct from any participant moderators need to take the following actions:

* Warn involved participant(s) of their behaviour and the possible consequences.
* Remove repeat offenders from the session.
* Overlook chat interactions where the same rules apply.
